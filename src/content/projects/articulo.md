## What Is Articulo

Articulo is a mobile app that provides a way to consume content that you trust. Follow people who inspire you and read what they read!

This project was a part of my Summer Internship at [AOL, Inc (now Oath)](https://www.oath.com/). As a team of 3 developers, we built the proof of concept prototype in 6 weeks and have a working iOS app in TestFlight.

I took a significant part in the implementation of the app in React Native, managing the code on BitBucket, creating weekly sprints, as well as the ideation for the app concept and product development.
