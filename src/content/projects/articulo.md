## The Product

Built as part of a small, cross-functional engineering team at AOL (now Yahoo), Articulo focused on transforming content consumption into a curated, user-driven experience, emphasizing clarity, trust, and usability. The result was a fully functional iOS proof of concept, delivered within a six-week development cycle and distributed via TestFlight.

During the project, I contributed heavily to both product and engineering decisions, working on core application features in React Native, shaping the underlying architecture, and collaborating on the overall product concept and UX direction.

## My Role

As a software engineer on a three-person team, I worked across the full product lifecycle, including:

- Implemented core mobile features using React Native
- Managed source control and delivery workflows
- Organized development into weekly sprints
- Contributed to product ideation, UX decisions, and feature prioritization
- Shipped a production-ready prototype under tight time constraints

This experience laid the foundation for my later work building and owning end-to-end, product-driven platforms.

## How We Built It

The project followed a complete product development process:

- Product ideation and validation
- Wireframing and information architecture
- Iterative development and testing
- Internal distribution and feedback via TestFlight
