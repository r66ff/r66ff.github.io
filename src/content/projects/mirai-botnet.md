## Research Overview

Mirai is a botnet which targeted the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and [caused major Internet platforms and services](https://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/) to be unavailable to large swathes of users in Europe and North America on October 21st 2016.

As a capstone project in Cybersecurity, we simulated the botnet in order to determine any identifying characteristics or behaviors, which would allow for a situational awareness report.

## Research Objectives

The primary goals of this research were:

1. **Simulate the Mirai botnet** in a controlled environment
2. **Analyze network traffic patterns** generated by the botnet
3. **Identify unique characteristics** that could distinguish Mirai traffic
4. **Develop detection methods** for network administrators
5. **Create situational awareness guidelines** for incident response

## Methodology

Our research approach included:

- Setting up a controlled lab environment
- Deploying IoT devices as test subjects
- Capturing and analyzing network traffic
- Identifying attack signatures and patterns
- Documenting findings for security professionals

## Key Findings

Through our analysis, we identified several characteristic behaviors of Mirai botnet traffic that could aid in detection and mitigation efforts. These findings contribute to the cybersecurity community's understanding of IoT-based threats.

## Impact

This research provides valuable insights for:
- Network security professionals
- IoT device manufacturers
- Security operations centers
- Incident response teams
